        <section class="section context">Upgrading your graphics card is actually really easy. Hopefully, this guide will
            help you to feel confident about installing a new graphics card, even if it's your very
            first time. MSI provides an <a class="xref" href="https://www.msi.com/Landing/beef-up-your-rig" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">easy upgrade guide</a> for you to choose the right
            graphics card, which is a great place to go if you're unsure of where to start looking.
            Before you start getting ready for the journey, the first thing you should do is check
            your current hardware information:</section>
        <section><ol class="ol steps"><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Check compatibility with your power supply: confirm the output (wattage and
                    amperage) that your power supply is capable of, and compare this to the power
                    requirements for the graphics card you are looking for. Sites like <a class="xref" href="https://www.evga.com/power-meter/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">EVGA's Power Meter</a> can help you determine compatibility between
                    parts as well. </span>
            </li><li class="li step">
                <span class="ph cmd">Check compatibility with your case: graphics cards vary in length, and
                    depending on the size of your case and where the graphics card is able to be
                    mounted, some cards may be too large. Check the measurements in your chosen
                    graphics card's descriptions to confirm that they will fit in your case. </span>
